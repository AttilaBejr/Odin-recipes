    <h1>My new favorite recipe</h1>
    <p>
      This easy, stripped-down version of eggs benedict involves no poaching, or
      hollandaise sauce making, which are the top two reasons people don’t make
      eggs benedict. Even if you master both those elements, and if you’ve seen
      our videos on them there’s a good chance you have, classic eggs benedict
      is still not something you make for one, which is why this method is such
      an exciting breakthrough. Thanks to some baked-in-a-ham-cup eggs, and a
      simple-to-make lemon butter sauce, the taste is virtually identical to
      classic eggs Benedict. One could argue baked eggs can’t compare to
      perfectly poached ones, so if you want to poach instead, feel free, but
      the lemon butter sauce here is no compromise. All we’ve done is remove the
      yolk from a hollandaise, and since we’re serving this over eggs, I don’t
      think it’s going to be missed. In fact, I believe some, if not most, will
      find this version preferable, which is why I really do hope you give it a
      try soon. Enjoy!
